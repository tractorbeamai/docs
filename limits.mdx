The following limits apply to accounts, graphs, and documents (as specified):

| Metric             | Current Limit  |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| Graphs per account | 50,000         |
| Triples per graph  | 100,000        |
| Graph name length  | 128 characters |

<Tip>

We believe most of these limits (and other performance metrics) will be improved by an order of magnitude or more before our public launch.

If you are or anticipate brushing up against these limits, [contact us](mailto:support@tractorbeam.ai).
We can raise most limits per-account upon request.

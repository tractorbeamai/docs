**Tractorbeam** is a platform for building, storing, and searching knowledge graphs for fast, deterministic LLM reasoning and retrieval.

- **Cheap:** Don't store infrequently accessed data on expensive DRAM. Store billions of triples in low-cost object storage, made fast by our custom-tuned NVMe cache.
- **Accurate:** Model your domain's unique semantics in your graph's ontology for day-one domain-tuned retrieval.
- **Serverless:** Pay only for what you use. Separate billing for storage and compute. Scale to zero when inactive.

_The following is outdated._

Tractorbeam is a unified API for building AI applications that leverage your customers' data.
We take care of all the hard parts of semantic search (optimized queries, embedding, hybrid vector search) and AI-first integrations, so you can get back to building features that matter.
We also take care of the whole OAuth flow, offering an easy way to connect to your customers' data sources.

Tractorbeam works by allowing your users to connect their data sources (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, Slack, etc.) to your application.
This connection process is faciliated through **Tractorbeam Connect**, a set of client-side components that provide a secure and slick way for your users to connect their data sources to your application.
Once they've connected their data, we'll get to work behind the scenes to index their data, optimize their queries, and power your application's AI features.

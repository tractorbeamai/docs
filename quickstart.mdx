<Steps>
<Step title="Create a new Next.js project">
Create a new Next.js project using the `create-next-app` utility.
```bash
npx create-next-app
```
<Info>
This tutorial assumes you are using the default `create-next-app` configuration: TypeScript (Yes), ESLint (Yes), Tailwind CSS (Yes), `src/` directory (No), App Router (Yes), and default import alias (Yes).
</Info>

</Step>
<Step title="Install dependencies">
Install the required dependencies.
- Our backend package, `@tractorbeamai/backend`, runs secure, server-side token generation and search requests.
- Our frontend package, `@tractorbeamai/react`, provides React components for your users to connect their data sources.

```bash
npm install @tractorbeamai/backend @tractorbeamai/react
```
</Step>
<Step title="Create a project in the Tractorbeam Dashboard">
Create a new project in the [Tractorbeam Dashboard](https://dashboard.tractorbeam.ai). (If you don't have an account, you can [sign up for free](https://dashboard.tractorbeam.ai/signup).)

Once you have created a project, **generate a new API key pair** on the API Keys page.
You should have a publishable key (starts with `pk_`) and a secret key (starts with `sk_`). Keep these keys safe, as they will be used to authenticate your requests.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a `/api/token` endpoint">
To authenticate requests as originating from a) your application and b) a specific user, you will need to create an API route to issue signed tokens.

Create a new file at `app/api/token/route.ts` with the following contents:
```ts
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { createToken } from '@tractorbeamai/backend';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { userId } = req.body;
  const token = await createToken(userId);
  res.status(200).json({ token });
}
```
</Step>

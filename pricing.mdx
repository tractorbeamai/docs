As we bill primarily on reads and writes, your monthly spend on Tractorbeam should be strongly correlated with your application's usage.

Because Tractorbeam is [built on low-cost object storage](/architecture), we can charge a per-GB storage cost two orders of magnitude less than other managed graph database offerings.

<Tip>

While we're in private beta, **everything is free**, though our usage [limits](/limits) are fairly restrictive.
(We expect these to improve by multiple orders of magnitude as we continue to develop and scale our offering.)

</Tip>

The following is a ballpark estimate of our current expectations for pricing at launch.

## Pricing Details

| Operation | Price                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Storage   | $0.50 per GB per month |
| Writes    | $2.00 per GB           |
| Reads     | $0.05 per GB           |

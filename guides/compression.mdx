title: Compression
---

Networking ingress/egress costs (from your cloud provider) can add up quickly, especially for bulk data uploads or large responses. We recommend compressing your requests and accepting compressed responses.

**We support the `br`, `gzip`, `deflate`, and `zstd` compression methods.**

To enable compression, set the [standard HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Compression):

- `Content-Encoding: <method>` to indicate you've compressed the request body
- `Accept-Encoding: <method>` to request a compressed response

Note that these only reduce the number of bytes sent over the network, not the amount persisted and/or billed by us. (Your cloud provider likely bills for this network traffic.)

<Tip>
  If you're sending requests from the browser (i.e. in a SPA) or a high-level
  HTTP library like [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or
  [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/), some compression headers (though
  likely not all methods) may be set automatically.

title: Response Format
---

All responses from the Tractorbeam API use JSON and follow the [JSend specification](https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend).

## Success Response

Everything is great, and the resource you created/requested is returned.

The HTTP code returned with this response will always be a `200`.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "Example"
  }
}
```

## Failure Response

_You_ did something wrong, and your request could not be processed.
For example, a required field was missing or the resource you were trying to create already exists.
The response body will contain a list of specific errors or a general error message.

The HTTP code returned with this response will always be a `3XX` or `4XX`.

```json
{
  "status": "fail",
  "data": {
    "field": "Error message"
  }
}
```

## Error Response

_We_ did something wrong, and your request could not be processed.
The response body may contain a general error message.

The HTTP code returned with this response will always be a `500`.

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Error description"
}
```
